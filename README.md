Built with Electron and JavaScript.

## Project website

The [live Deskprite website](https://justin-uurtsaikh.github.io/Deskprite/) is published from [`docs/`](docs/index.html), with a dedicated [transparent PNG sprite and setup guide](https://justin-uurtsaikh.github.io/Deskprite/guide/). It uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no build step or third-party assets.

## Run it on Mac or Windows

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 22.12 or later). On Mac, Electron 44 requires macOS 13 or later.
2. Open Terminal (Mac) or PowerShell (Windows) in this `deskprite` folder.
3. Run:

   ```sh
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Choose a **Starter buddy**, **Import sprite sheet**, or **Draw your own**, then select **Create & launch**.

Your buddy appears as only a transparent sprite—no border, white card, hover buttons, heart, or exit control. Drag the sprite itself anywhere. New buddies start at `112 px` and can be sized from `64 px` to `192 px`. They switch to their walk frames while moving, return to idle when they stop, and wrap to the opposite side after walking fully past any screen edge. With multiple buddies open, each one wanders on its own staggered schedule and picks a different recent direction.

## Make a sprite

### Pick a starter buddy

Open **Starter buddies**, choose a character, adjust its name and size, then select **Create & launch**. Every bundled starter includes four idle frames and four walking frames with a transparent background.

### Import a sprite sheet

Deskprite accepts transparent PNG sprite sheets with real transparent pixels.
After upload, it shows multiple square-cell grid choices such as `4 × 1 · 256px` or `12 × 8 · 32px`. Pick the one that puts one complete character in each cell, then choose each clip's row, starting column, and frame count. A common layout is four idle frames on row 1 and four walk frames on row 2.

The source must be the clean PNG sprite sheet—not a screenshot with a checkerboard background, labels, grid lines, borders, or a white background. Deskprite's sprite validation and packaging currently support PNG files only.

### Drawing a sprite in Deskprite

Switch to **Draw your own**. Choose your desired brush color and size, draw the current frame, then use **Add frame** for the next pose. Make at least one visible `Idle` frame and one visible `Walk` frame for it to create a sprite. Turn on **Previous frame** to see a semi-transparent onion-skin reference while drawing the next frame; it is never saved into your art.

For the full workflow and layout examples, see [`docs/SPRITE_WORKFLOWS.md`](docs/SPRITE_WORKFLOWS.md).

## Create an app file

After `npm install`, run:

```sh
npm run dist
```

On Windows, the portable `.exe` is created in `release/`. On a Mac, a `.dmg` is created there instead.

## App icon

Deskprite uses Sprout's first idle frame for its app and Dock icon. If that source artwork changes, rebuild the icon with:

```sh
npm run icon
```

## Privacy and safety choices

- Sprites are copied into Deskprite's private app-data folder; nothing is uploaded.
- Only PNGs with real transparent pixels and visible artwork are accepted.
- Each source image is limited to 5 MB and 16 megapixels. Animation sets are limited to eight frames per clip and 12 MB total.
- The renderer cannot access Node.js or your file system directly.

## Development check

Run the automated tests on their own with:

```sh
npm test
```

Run the full local quality check with:

```sh
npm run check
```

GitHub Actions runs the same quality check automatically on every push and pull request.

Regenerate the README animation and its reduced-motion still from Sprout's bundled walk frames with:

```sh
npm run demo-gif
```

This project includes source code only. Run it on your Mac or Windows desktop to test the transparent companion window, then package it with `npm run dist`.
